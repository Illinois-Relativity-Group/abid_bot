particle tracer manual

1. ittxt.py: generates folder-iteration correspondence. Once started tracing do NOT rerun the whole file. Use append.

2. ptctracer.py: trace given particles. 
   This program can continue to trace automatically. You can run it again once the first run ends to continue tracing.
   This program also detects duplicate and bad data in h5folder and updates the iters_txt, so do NOT rerun the full iters_txt after you started the particle tracer.

3. split_dat.py: splits the traced particle data into dat_new/<time>.dat for reading in abid bot. Link/put them inside bin/particle_code

4. submitjob.sh and job_submit_ptctrace_frontera.pbs: submission script for use on frontera.

Use gw_rho_merger.py and prpare_2.py to combine density and gw images into a single image.

Move both of these scripts into the folder where you have both folders of images (you can store the images in different folders however it is recommended to keep a folder of rho images and a folder of gw images at the same level. Follow the instructions in each script to make the combined images.

gw_rho_merger.py can't be run in a terminal. You must open gimp, click on filters, go down to python-fu and click console. Then copy the code inside the script into the console and hit ENTER twice.

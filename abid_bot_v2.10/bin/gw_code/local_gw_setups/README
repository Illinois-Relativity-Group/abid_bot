for the cpp code to work, follow the directions in 'install_fftw.txt' to install correct packages for cpp code
then you need your Psi4 file of choice, in my experience, i usually use 3 because it works and the man hasn't complained about the images
  but i think the reason why psi4 has many extraction radii (1-9 correspond to increasing extraction radii) is because
  the smaller ones closer to the BH might have weird numeric stuff going on and the larger ones too far also might have weird numeric stuff going on
  to see if the file is good, just run THIS OTHER SCRIPT THAT I HAVENT MADE YET and plot it versus time
 
if there are multiple psi4 files that are needed to cover the entire time range, combine them into 1, duplicates and order will be fixed in script
  can do this like 'cat file1 file2 >> file'

IN run_hphc.sh SET THE VARIABLES
  root: path to the place you will run these scripts
  test_flag: should be 0, these are for test cases that the man had me visualize to see their behavior, see the python code for details
  fol_name: gwdata folder where .vtk files will be written to 
  update_lookup: creating the lookup tables for the chosen grid take a long time b/c it involves the calculations of the orthogonal functions ie the
    spin weighted s=-2 spherical harmonics; these involve loops that can't be bypassed (as far as i know) and factorials
  psi4_f: psi4 file
  M_ADM: same as in params
  cutoff_w: 0.05 works well for binaries, this is an artifact of the old cpp FFTW code, it needs to be lower than the fundamental frequency of wave
    wave geneartion, frequencies below are ignored b/c to avoid division by very small numbers in FFTW code
  extraction_r: r_areal in Psi4, its one of the last 4 columns and is labeled, it doesn't change much so just use the number from t=0
  files_per_folder: number of vtk files per folder, leave at 25
  dt:   this is gw_dt, look at time step between lines in Psi4
  num_modes:   is num columns of Psi4 - 5 divided by 2, printed out by calc_clm
  num_times:   num of rows in psi4 minus comments
  start_num:   set to 0 and end num to num_times to do entire range
  end_num:
  xy_max: creates the grid, is a square on xy
  xy_num:
  z_min:  can specify exact z range, usually its (-z to 0) to get nice image
  z_max:     see run_hphc.sh and the python for more details
  z_num:
  ignore the test variables
